## Digital Signal Processing
Some examples of digital signal processing are added here.

### Radar Range and Velocity Simulation
Use of 1D FFT for range measurement and 2D FFT for range and velocity measurement of a simulated FMWC radar is shown.
CFAR technique is implemented on the output 2D FFT for reliable estimate of the target vs. local noise. 
CFAR: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_false_alarm_rate

### Use of Kalman filter for noise cancellation of PPG
